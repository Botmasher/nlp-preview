	3. communicating with NLP
		- speech recognition
		- voice user interfaces
		- lab to create an Alexa skill
		- project: build speech recognition model using deep learning

## 2. School of AI Team
- put together by 20+ Udacity staff
- PhDs, engineers, teachers who are passionate about this

## 3. NLP Overview
- language as medium of communication
- as maybe "critical component of human intelligence"
- with machines doing so much, why not human language?
	- computers lagging behind
- learn to design and deploy a program that uses NLP

## 4. Context Is Everything
- consider this sentence:
	- "I was lured to see this on the promise of a smart, witty slice of ... intrigue. I was conned."
	- starts out with positive words but is a negative review
- compare these sentences:
	- "The sofa didn't fit through the door because it was too narrow."
	- "The sofa didn't fit through the door because it was too wide."
	- the anaphora refers back to two different items
	- requires applying knowledge about the world (wide things don't fit through narrow ones)
- think of your own sentence requiring cultural or background knowledge
	- me: "They gave me a choice between surfing and skydiving, but you know I can't stand heights!"

## 5. NLP and IBM Watson
- challenges but promise
- Armen, academic tech mentor
	- lectures and workshops
	- IBM Watson cognitive services
- often wears a "solution architect cap"
- clients use universities for dev
- more and more products use NLP
	- part of end-to-end-solutions
	- often augmented with vision
	- not just bag-of-words
- NLP as Hard Problem
	- means understanding words and meaning
	- ambiguity as making problem so difficult
	- consider: "This fountain is not drinking water"... how would a system parse and tokenize?
	- systems today understand how words relate and context surrounding utterance
- example: interacting with AirBnB reviews
	- why the need to scan through so many?
	- can't I describe what I want in my own words?
	- I want an apartment in Paris that's historic, quiet, near a good market and close to the city center
	- now the cognitive system should find reviews that match
- NLP systems now make inferences based on "large volumes of text"
	- context of our conversations
	- what we mean by our words
- two more to consider:
	- "wise man" vs "wise guy"
	- "slim chance" vs "fat chance"

## 6. Towards Augmented Intelligence
- will AI replace our jobs and take over the world?
	- "augmented" rather than "artificial" because they remove mundane tasks
	- "new collar jobs" will require new skills, new training
	- it is "an inflection point in human history" that's upon us
- preparing students to compete
	- growing emphasis on STEM
	- modern coding skills
	- but "right brain skills" will be competitive advantage for humans
- don't keep augmented intelligence in the lab
- what will you build?

# What's Next?

## 1. Ready to Level Up with NLP?
- me: this ended up being just the invitation to sign up for the course
- current link to the program: https://www.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892
- they say it offers material on Natural Language Processing and Speech Recognition, which matches the notes
- like other Nanodegrees, you will take courses and complete projects
- comes with your own AI mentor

- Some thoughts as I end this trial:
	- it would be good to review Deep Learning and ML through a site like http://www.fast.ai/
	- I'll leave my closeout thoughts in the README.md for this repo

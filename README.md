# Natural Language Processing sample course notes

My notes and examples for the Udacity preview lessons for their Natural Language Processing Nanodegree.

## Description

Udacity offers multiple sample lessons for you to try out their NLP Nanodegree at https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud892-preview. Since I incorporate NLP technology into my work and have a desire to learn even more, especially where linear algebra and heavier calculations are concerned, I'm eagerly making my way through all of the videos, notes and exercises. You'll find my notes and example code in this repo.

## Do I recommend the program?

I'm currently going through the last sample lesson. I'll leave some thoughts once I'm done.

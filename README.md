# Natural Language Processing sample course notes

My notes and examples for the Udacity preview lessons for their Natural Language Processing Nanodegree.

## Description

Udacity offers multiple sample lessons for you to try out their NLP Nanodegree at https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud892-preview. Since I incorporate NLP technology into my work and have a desire to learn even more, especially where linear algebra and heavier calculations are concerned, I'm eagerly making my way through all of the videos, notes and exercises. You'll find my notes and example code in this repo.

## Do I recommend the program?

I went through all of the text, videos and exercises offered in the free trial lessons. I even ended up building a bit of a side project to solve the "phonetic pangram" problem.

There are three technical pieces I'll consider here: programming, human language and AI. Programming skills don't seem like they'll require much beyond intermediate comfort with Python, and you could get by with less if you've worked in another language but only played around with Python. Regexes should already be a thing for you. As for language, I think you'll want an understanding of more than they let on here. The problems are centered on the kinds of things linguists care about, but, at least in these sample lessons, your training focuses on getting to solutions and not on understanding the linguistic nature of the challenges in any deep way. AI is the biggest skillset you'll need. You'll find that you need to understand Deep Learning, DNNs and ML models like HMM before continuing. Solid statistics and Bayesian reasoning seem like they'll help quite a bit.

All told, I like that you get to work through material thoughtfully curated by a team who clearly worked hard on the scripts and lesson plans. Delivery isn't energetic entertainment, but I feel there's character behind their calm and enunciated script reading, of which I definitely caught glimpses in their banter. The VUI instructor and the IBM Watson guest instructor were my favorites. Both brought up points I've been turning over in my head outside of class. The instructor who introduced TF-IDF will definitely challenge your math and AI skills if you're shaky on the ones I mentioned above.

If you're a programmer with merely some understanding of AI but a zeal for computational linguistics, this could be a great way to start. Ditto if you're an AI wonder who's mildly interested in linguistics. If you're just sort of into this but don't feel strong in either language or AI, my hunch is you'll want to start with [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/), go through the material in these sample lessons and then tinker with a few Alexa skills.
